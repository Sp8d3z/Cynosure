     I am a prior service Marine and a father.  Looking for a job in Web Development. 
  This is something that I have had a love for my entire life.  
  Just the thought of creating something form scratch, that people will not 
  only love but also would want to tell people about.  I enjoy both working
  with a team and independently.  Each for different reasons. With a team 
  there is the aspect of learning different things from different types of people.  
  Independently, it gives me a chance to explore my own creativity.

    This also goes for some of my other hobbies. One of which, is cooking. No matter
  where i go in life somehow i end up cooking. Apparently i love the kitchen just as 
  much as I enjoy computers and technology. In the kitchen just as much as behind the keyboard
  there is always a puzzel. I believe that is what intrigues me. Not everything will turn out the 
  same as the last time. Also you can always find another way to do things.  Ultimatly it 
  keeps your mind going. Not to mention the constant learning and humility that comes along
   with it.

     I suppose that leads me to my Aspirations.  I have two of which you have already read about.
	Allow me to get a little more in depth.  As a child I have always been a fan of good food. Though,
	no a picky person there are some things that I may not enjoy eating, however i am interested in learning
	to cook many types of food.  One day however, I would like ot have my own restaurant. I have already chosen
	a name.  HERMIA's.  It is my mothers first name, though she doesnt use it, I though it would be appropreate.
	As I love my mother, she has always been a motivator in my life.  Dispite hard times she is always postive.  
	That is the kind legacy I would like to not only leave behind for the world , also to pass on to my children.
	In any case this place would be a lounge setting, allowing for people to come and enjoy some of my favorite appitizers
	main entrees and sweets. In a comfortable atmosphere that promotes happiness and good times. <br>
	   
	   The other is to create my own software company.  I like to experiment and try new things as i have stated before. With computers,
	   and technology the possibilties are endless.  Even though it seems as if the industry has taken off I am quite positive
	   that i have alot to offer. It is my observation that, many of the new things that emerge. Arent really new, just a 
	   different approch on someone else's idea.  I would like to bring some new things to the table.  Though I am aware that
	   alone this task would be difficult.  Due to my awareness, is part of the reason for this site. An opportunity to find, 
	   like minded people to join me on this journy to an actual new world.  
	
</p>
<p>
   Honestly , I hope that you have enjoyed this light reading, and inste to my life and ambitions. I look forward to future of new
   developments.  As the world will constantly change,we can let it pass by, fight against it, or help make it better.  The choice in inside
   of all of us.
